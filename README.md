# Airline Flight Ticket Price Analysis using Python ✈️📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an airline flight dataset to identify the factors influencing ticket price variation.
The dataset includes details such as airline, source and destination cities, class, departure and arrival times, number of stops, booking days left, and ticket price.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze flight frequency across different airlines
- To study time-based travel patterns (departure & arrival slots)
- To understand source and destination travel demand
- To analyze ticket price variations across airlines and travel class
- To examine the effect of booking timing (days left) on price
- To analyze route-based ticket price variation
- To find the average price of Vistara (Delhi → Hyderabad) Business class tickets

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Python | Main programming language |
| Pandas, NumPy | Data processing |
| Matplotlib, Seaborn | Visualizations |
| Jupyter Notebook | Code execution & analysis |

## 📂 Dataset
`airlines_flights_data.csv`

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Airline-wise flight frequency
- Departure & arrival time distributions
- Source & destination city analysis
- Average ticket price for each airline
- Economy vs Business class price comparison
- Days left vs ticket price trend
- Route-specific price behavior

## 🧾 Key Insights
- Vistara has the highest number of flights, SpiceJet the lowest
- Morning & Early Morning flights are most frequent
- Business class fares are much higher than Economy
- Last-minute booking (1–2 days) shows highest ticket cost
- Premium airlines have significantly higher average pricing

## 📍 Conclusion
Ticket prices are dynamic and change depending on airline type, route, travel class, time of booking and departure/arrival timing.  
Booking early and choosing non-peak hours can reduce travel expense.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Prediction model using Machine Learning
- Price forecasting dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Seasonal trend comparison and real-time pricing integration
